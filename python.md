    The key is the first line, which checks the value of the built-in variable  __name__. This string variable is automatically created and is always de-  fined when Python runs. (Try putting print(__name__) inside one of your  programs or type it in an interactive session.) Inside an imported module,  __name__ holds the name of the module, whereas in the main program its  value is "__main__".
